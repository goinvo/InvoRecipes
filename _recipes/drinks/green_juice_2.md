* 1 large handful of kale
* 1 large handful of spinach
* 1 average sized kiwi, peeled
* 1-2 Granny Smith apples, whole
* 1 banana (blended, not juiced)

In a juicer, juice the kale, spinach, kiwi, and apple(s). Add the mixture to a blender with the banana and puree. The banana needs to go in the blender because itâ€™s too mushy for a juicer.
