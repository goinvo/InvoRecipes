* 4 oz watermelon juice
* 1 oz Mint Simple Syrup (see below)
* 1 oz Lime Juice (Fresh is best)
* 1 oz water
* 1 1/2 oz Tequila (optional)

To prepare the watermelon juice, puree chunks of watermelon in a blender. If you are planning on storing the juice overnight, it is best to strain the pulp out of the juice.

Mix all ingredients and serve cold.

## Mint Simple Syrup
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 oz - 1 oz fresh mint leaves

Boil the sugar and water until the syrup is clear. Remove from heat and then add the mint leaves and let rest for ~20 minutes. Strain the mint leaves from the syrup. Chill.
