Adapted from [Jason Dominy's technique for the Clever Coffee Dripper](http://jasondominy.com/post/14694412076/how-i-brew-with-the-clever-dripper-the-video)

* Heat water to 93Â°C.
* Place a [filter](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001E5E0OC) in the brewer (we use [this Bonavita one](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MFJX7P4/))
* (Optional, but recommended) Rinse filter with hot water and drain water from the brewer.
* Grind 23g of coffee and place it in the empty filter.
* Pour 320g of hot water over the coffee.
* (Optional, but recommended) Gently stir the coffee slurry to insure the grounds are not all clumped at the top.
* Let steep for 2 minutes and then drain over your mug.


### Setting the Grind
For simplicity, I've chosen to keep the variable of coffee dose (23g), water dose (320g) and steep time (2 minutes) fixed. Then, as needed, I adjust the grind setting based on taste. 

As Jason Dominy suggests, we are shooting for most of the coffee to be drained after 1 minute and 30 seconds of draining. If you have a lot of liquid at that point, you need to coarsen the grind. If it drains too much faster than that, then you need to adjust the grinder to grind finer.
