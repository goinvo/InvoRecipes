(This recipe is kinda exact in its ingredient ratios. It's made best with a scale.)

INGREDIENTS
* 520g  Bread Flour     
* 340g  Water       
* 42g   Sugar       
* 6g    Instant yeast   
* 8g    Salt
* 520g  butter (softened)

DIRECTIONS
* Mix everything except butter
* Knead until smooth
* Add soft butter (cut into cubes)
* Fridge dough ~24 hrs (cold rise)

(This part is more flexible. Feel free to shape accordingly. Removing bubbles is important though.)

* Set for 20 minutes
* Make each dough long and roll it together (1 cycle)
* Set for another 20 minutes
* Repeat step 6 (2 cycle)
* Place doughs in bread mold
* 365 F Bake for 40 minutes
