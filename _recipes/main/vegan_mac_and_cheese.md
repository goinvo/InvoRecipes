### Ingredients

* 4 tablespoons Earth Balance butter
* 3 cups vegetable broth
* 1/4 cup flour
* 1/8 cup soy sauce
* 1 and 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder
* 1 tablespoon paprika
* 1 tablespoon turmeric
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 cup nutritional yeast
* 1 pound cooked macaroni pasta

### Topping (if desired)

* 2 tablespoons Earth Balance butter
* 1 cup breadcrumbs

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350Â°F.

In a medium size dutch oven, over low-medium heat, melt the Earth Balance, then slowly incorporate flour and vegetable broth; whisk until smooth.

Stir in soy sauce, garlic powder, paprika, turmeric, salt and pepper.
Add nutritional yeast and mix until the sauce is smooth and creamy.

Add cooked macaroni to the sauce and stir until all pasta is coated evenly. (If you prefer the mac and cheese to be creamier, forgo baking it and serve at this stage.)

Optional: transfer mixture to a 9x13 baking dish.
To make the topping, melt the Earth Balance and toss in the breadcrumbs until coated. Top macaroni mixture with the breadcrumbs.

Bake for 30 minutes. Let rest for five minutes before serving.
