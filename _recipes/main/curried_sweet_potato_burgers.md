### Ingredients

* 1 cup dried yellow or red lentils
* 2 cups water
* 1 and 1/2 cups cooked sweet potato, mashed
* 1 cup cooked quinoa
* 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 small yellow onion, diced
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 2 tsp coriander
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp cayenne
* salt and pepper to taste
* 2 cups fresh spinach
* 3/4 - 1 cup flour
* 1 tbsp corn starch
* coconut oil for saut√©ing

### Toppings

* Mango Chutney
* Aioli
* Spinach / Arugula
* Cheese

### Instructions

Rinse lentils thoroughly and cook in 2 cups of water until very tender, 45-60 minutes. (Next time, I'd like to try replacing the lentils with cooked and ground up chickpeas). Meanwhile in a microwave or oven, bake sweet potatoes until soft. Once cooled, remove skin and mash.

Saute onions and garlic in 1 tbsp of coconut oil until translucent. Add to cooked lentils along with spices, quinoa, spinach and mashed sweet potatoes. Stir to combine. While stirring add flour and cornstarch until fully incorporated.

Shape into patties and refrigerate for 2-3 hours.

Heat coconut oil over medium heat in a *nonstick* skillet. Cook patties for about 5 minutes on each side until browned.
