This recipe was given to my mom by a family friend. We have added to it over the years and have passed it on to dozens of people.

* 10 cups water (or broth you cooked the chicken in)
* 3 cans petite-diced tomatoes (Hunt's brand is best)
* 1 onion diced
* 1 teaspoon pepper (it actually calls for 1 Tablespoon but that burns your lips)
* 1 Tablespoon chili powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoon comino
* 1 Tablespoon garlic powder
* 9 chicken bullion cubes
* cilantro (about 3 Tablespoons, chopped)

Boil chicken in water for about 20 minutes.  Let chicken cool then cut
up into 3/4 inch pieces.  (Save the chicken broth to substitute for
the water.)

Brown the onion in a bit of oil in a large pot.
Add the tomatoes, water (or chicken broth) and spices. Simer for 15 to 20 minutes.

Add chicken and cilantro. Simmer 5 minutes more.

Serve over tortilla chips, grated Monterrey Jack Cheese, and avocado.

I like to add cans of washed black beans or kidney beans. I will also sometimes add grilled portobello mushrooms instead of chicken.
